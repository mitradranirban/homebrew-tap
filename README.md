# homebrew-tap
Homebrew cascs for my apps such as [Offed](https://fonts.atipra.in/offed.html) 

To install Offed through homebrew open a terminal in your mac and run these commands
### 1. Add this repository to your Homebrew
`brew tap mitradranirban/tap`

#### 2. Install the app (Homebrew will now handle the quarantine removal)
`brew install --cask offed`
